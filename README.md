## How to install on your computer

```bash
# Clone this git repo:
git clone git@github.com:szTheory/real-world-elixir-apps.git

cd real-world-elixir-apps/

# The apps are linked to as git submodules.
# This will take some time... (see comment below for possible speedup)
git submodule update --init

# OR if you've got git 2.9+ installed try to run updates in parallel:
# git submodule update --init --jobs 4
```

## Information for Contributors

### How to add a Real World App

Given a GitHub repo for an app `githubuser/foo`:

```bash
# Inside the project root:
git submodule add -b master git@github.com:githubuser/foo.git apps/foo
```

### Updating the apps submodules to latest

The apps in `apps/` are git submodules. Git submodules are locked to a revision and don't stay in sync with the latest revision.

To update the revisions, run:

```bash
# This will take some time:
git submodule foreach git pull origin master
```
